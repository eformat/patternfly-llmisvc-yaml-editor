# patternfly-llmisvc-yaml-editor

This project is now a static PatternFly demo powered by [Next.js static export](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/getting-started/deploying#static-export). To work on it locally:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

To produce the static build:

```bash
npm run build   # outputs to ./build
```

You can preview the exported site locally with `npm run preview`.
